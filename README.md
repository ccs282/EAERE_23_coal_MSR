# EAERE_2023_coal_MSR
 
Welcome to my paper's machine room. It is not necessarily perfectly tidy (yet), but the engine runs smoothly.

The main file to replicate the findings is "LETS_GO.do", which draws upon most do-files in the repository as well as the csv-data [not available for legal reasons; data from Bloomberg]. 

In the "LETS_GO.do"-file, you can also change the main event study parameters, such as model type, event and estimation window lengths, apply weights etc.

Having run the main file, you can separately run the "MSFE.do"-file, which executes the forecasting performance calculations.

In the coming weeks, I will either make the Stata code more readable and/or write a cleaner R code.

Enjoy!
